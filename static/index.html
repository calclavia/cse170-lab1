		<h4>About</h4>
		<p>
			It all started in primary school when I fell in love with computer games. As an ambitious eleven-year-old, I believed I could create better games than the ones I played. I always had this passion to create and tinker with things I've got, and so I picked
			up programming in hope of getting into the gaming industry.
		</p>
		<p>
			After many years of self-learning, fiddling with code and making web applications, I started developing Minecraft mods and tackled larger projects. I assembled and led an online team of programmers and artists to create new games and mods, developing
			my business acumen.
		</p>
		<p>
			My interests expanded as I became more acquainted with software engineering. I branched into indie-game development and entrepreneurship, now working on my startup to create mobile apps and games.
